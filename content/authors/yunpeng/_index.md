I am currently investigating the apparent depression of photosynthesis rates in temperate and boreal forests in spring after cold winter, which is a phenomenon that has been overlooked in global models. Through [PhotoCold](https://www.wsl.ch/de/projekte/cold-stress-mighgt-limit-carbon-gain-also-in-a-warming-climate.html) and [Velux](https://veluxstiftung.ch/projects/) projects, I intend to pinpoint the reasons causing this photosynthetic depression and improve the model efficiency.
