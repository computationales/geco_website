I am in the first year of my PhD as a Doctoral Fellow at the ETH AI Center. My research interests lie at the intersection of Machine Learning and Environmental Science. I’m particularly interested in AI for scientific discovery, data-centric machine learning, as well as usability and trustworthiness of machine learning methods in sustainability applications. I am part of DS3Lab led by Ce Zhang and the Geocomputation and Earth Observation group led by Benjamin Stocker.
